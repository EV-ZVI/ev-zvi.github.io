With globalisation of human movement, increased density of human populations, climate change and loss of natural habitats, there is increased risk of interaction between species, and within species. This allows the emergence of infectious diseases by increased contact and cross-species transmission, as well as movement of infectious agents into geographic regions where they have not been found before. Infectious disease not only affects human health, but has an impact on the stability of food production and the survival of wild species. This is formulated in the One Health approach to infectious disease, where the possibility of infectious agent movement between species, including humans, is key. Whilst a major driver of emerging virus disease research is public health concern over zoonotic infections, there are also veterinary drivers for emerging viral diseases; such diseases may have devastating effects on wildlife populations, affecting the ability of these populations to withstand the global environmental changes we are causing; they may be diseases of production animals, affecting food production efficiency and the ability to trade; and finally they may affect domestic pet animals, causing welfare issues and increased costs to owners.
